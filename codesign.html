			<p>When it comes to mending, I like to think about it as a creative process. <span class="highlight">While we typically tend to try and hide when things are broken,
				or immediately throw them out, mending can be a way to push back against our idea of what a 'broken' or unusuable object or clothing item is.</span><i>Visible Mending</i>  is a specific mending practice wherein one makes their 'mend' highly visible or otherwise decorative. 
			<p>This is my personal favorite way to mend and darn my clothes because something as simple as choosing a bright blue thread to fix a tan sweater tells a story. When you participate in visible mending, you become a designer of your garment alongside its original makers - the factory workers and its designer,
				the moth that ate a hole through it, nail, loose thrad, and even with the rest of your wardrobe!
				<span class="highlight">Mending is a form of design and moreso, it can be a form of affection and care for both your own clothes and yourself.</span>
