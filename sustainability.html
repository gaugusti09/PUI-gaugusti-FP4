			<p><span class="highlight">There's no unwinding the importance of sustainability when it comes to talking textiles.</span> Due to the high demand for
				new clothes and fabric-made items constantly, there is an immense amount of waste that occurs within production & long after
				a garment's purchase. The main source of textiles in discarded waste is clothing -- In 2018, 11.3 million tons of textile waste ended up in landfills.
			</p>
			<p> Mending Practices like <span class="highlight">patching and darning </span> are great ways to prolong the lives of your clothing and keep them in use!
				What are those? I'm glad you asked! <span class="highlight">Darning</span> is a sewing technique for repairing holes or worn fabric areas, it is the creation of a miniature weaving in a preexisting garment.
				<span class="highlight">Patching</span> (and patchwork) which is much more well known, is the practice of placing another fabric piece over a hole and stitching it in place.
				Both of these are great ways to help reduce waste and also keep your clothes nice for longer.
			</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">BUT I'M NERVOUS TO START..?</span></p>
			<p>That's okay! If you're not quite ready to pick up the sewing needle, there are a lot of other ways to reduce waste such as thrifting, clothes swaps, or making your own.</p>
