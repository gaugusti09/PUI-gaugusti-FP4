			<p>Have you ever ripped a hole in your pants? Or tore your favorite sock? If so, I'm.. really sorry, but I do have good news!
				When an article of clothing is damaged, due to its makeup, it can <i>also</i> be repaired. 
				This might seem like somewhat of a daunting task, but it's actually not only very simple to try out, but a great skill to have.
			</p>
			<p><span id="highlight">Textile restoration is the practice and process of restoring textiles to their original condition (or to another one that otherwise "fixes" damage).</span>
				If you're curious what a 'textile' is, it's any item made from natural or synthetic fibers! This includes not only clothes like a pair of mittens or a favorite coat,
				but also curtains, bedspreads, insulation for our homes, baskets, hot air balloons, and so much more! 
			</p>
			<p> Fabrics + Textiles are highly versatile and their conservation is incredibly important to preserving our cultures and histories.
				On a smaller scale, however, being able to repair your own clothes is super neat and can be an engaging, helpful hobby! <span id="highlight">Never fear for your lucky sock, you can give it a second life!</span>
